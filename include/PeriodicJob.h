 * IPeriodicJob) from @ref IPeriodicJob in case it is possible
 * that we'd have multiple child classes inheriting from @ref
 * PeriodicJob and then another class inheriting from these
 * children which want access to @ref IPeriodicJob member
 * variables (causing two or more instance of the same member).
 * However in our code no diamond inheritance concerns exists;
 * hence no need for virtual inheritance.
