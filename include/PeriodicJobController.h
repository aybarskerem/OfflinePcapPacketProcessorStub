/**
 * @file
 *
 * @brief This file contains the class declaration for an
 * implementor class of @ref IPeriodicJobController declared in
 * IPeriodicJobController.h
 *
 * This file contains and extern variable @ref
 * g_ptr_periodic_class_controller_instance which is expected to
 * be used as the only instance to perform
 * @ref PeriodicJobController class methods if we want all of
 * the PeriodicJobs to be manipulated under one roof. 
 *
 * However, this class is not designed to be a Singleton. So,
 * whenever there is a need of multiple controllers, say to be
 * able to manipulate different types of PeriodicJobs in
 * different ways, then the caller code can instantiate its own
 * instance.
 *
 * The reason of using @ref
 * g_ptr_periodic_class_controller_instance is to provide a
 * single instance that can be used throughout the application
 * easily.
