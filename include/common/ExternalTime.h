   * @brief A Singleton class to hold and provide single source
   * of truth time value instead of relying on internal system
   * time for this project.
   *
   * Whenever this class's methods are requried; firstly
   * getInstance method of this class should be called to get
   * the one and only instance of this class and the methods
   * should be called on this instance.
   *
   * Whenever a @ref PcapPacket is received, its arrival time
   * info is to update the time used thorughout this project
   * instead of relying on the internal system clock. This is
   * important to make sure online & offline processing of a
   * packet behaves similar.
   *
   * Whenever a @ref PcapPacket is received, if the arrival time
   * is newer than the last time, the receiving party should
   * call set_current_time function on the Singleton instance to
   * set the ground-truth time to be stored in this class. Then
   * anyone needing the time can use get_current_time function
   * on the Singleton instance.
